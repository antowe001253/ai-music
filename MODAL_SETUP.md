# 🚀 Running Your Music Pipeline on Modal Cloud

## **Why Modal Will Fix the Issue**

The MPS (Apple Silicon) compatibility issue you're experiencing is common with MusicGen. Modal provides **proper CUDA GPUs** which are much more stable for generative AI models.

## **Quick Setup**

### **1. Install Modal**
```bash
pip install modal
```

### **2. Set up Modal account (free tier available)**
```bash
modal setup
```

### **3. Run your Christmas carol generation**
```bash
modal run modal_music_pipeline.py --prompt "Christmas carol song" --duration 30
```

## **What This Does**

1. **🚀 Loads on A10G GPU** - Much more stable than MPS
2. **📥 Downloads MusicGen** - Cached for future runs  
3. **🎵 Generates your Christmas carol** - Same pipeline, but stable
4. **💾 Downloads results** - Saves to `modal_output/complete_song.wav`

## **Expected Output**
```
🚀 Running Diff-SVC Music Pipeline on Modal
✅ Generation successful!
📝 Prompt: Christmas carol song
🖥️ Device: cuda
⏱️ Audio length: 30.0s
💾 Saved: modal_output/complete_song.wav
🎉 Modal generation completed successfully!
```

## **Your `complete_song.wav` will be at:**
```
modal_output/
├── complete_song.wav      # 🎵 Your Christmas carol!
└── instrumental.wav       # 🎹 Background music
```

## **Cost**
- **Free tier**: 30 GPU-hours/month
- **A10G GPU**: ~$0.60/hour
- **Your generation**: ~2-3 minutes = ~$0.03

## **Full Pipeline Integration**

To integrate your complete Phase 3 pipeline with Modal, you can:

1. **Upload your entire Diff-SVC project** to Modal
2. **Include your 15GB models** in Modal volumes
3. **Run the complete pipeline** with vocal synthesis

## **Test Command**
```bash
# This should work perfectly on Modal's CUDA GPUs
modal run modal_music_pipeline.py --prompt "Christmas carol song"
```

The same code that fails on MPS will work perfectly on Modal's CUDA environment!
